Requirement:
	Type "gs -h" to get your ghostscript version and
	device list. You need GNU ghostscript 6.53+ or
	AFPL Ghostscript 7.04+, and the "ijs" device listed
	among the device list to use this plugin.

	AFPL ghostscript 8.0 has some yet unidentified issues,
	and known not to work. Avoid it for the time being.

Installation:
	./configure
	make
	make install

	(be sure /usr/local/bin is in your path,
	if it isn't, try with "./configure --prefix=/usr")

	Check the content of the script "foomatic/copy_to_foomatic"
	  in this source bundle for notes on foomatic and cups

Usage:
	See ps2epl for selectable options.
        Change "EPL5700L" to "EPL5800L", or "EPL5900L"
	where appropriate.
	Print using "./ps2epl myfile.ps" and
	"cat myfile.epl >/dev/lp0".
	
	Alternatively, if your system is based on
	foomatic, have a look at the foomatic dir.

License:
	The ijs-derived part follows the same license
	as ijs. The rest under the GNU public license, 
	except "epl_compress.c", which is not to be
	used for any purpose other than in relation
 	to the Epson EPL series of printers.

=====================================================
Notes:

Almost all the files came as it was from the ijs-0.34 
distribution, except
 
	ChangeLog
	LIMITATIONS
	Makefile.in
	README	
	epl_*
	ijs_server_epsonepl.c
	ps2epl
	epl_docs/*
	foomatic/*

"Makefile.in" has been mildly adapted from ijs-0.34,
"ijs_server_epsonepl.c" adapted from "ijs_server_example.c"
"ps2epl" adapted from "ps2pdfwr" of ghostscript.
