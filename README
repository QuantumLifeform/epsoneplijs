What is this?
===========
  This project is named "epsonepl".
  It is a printer driver which gives ghostscript the ability
  to print to Epson EPL-5700L, EPL-5800L, EPL-5900L,
  EPL-6100L and EPL-6200L laser printers. EPL-6100L and EPL-6200L 
  support is not deeply tested (volunteers wanted!).

  There are some reports that LP-1400 (sold in Japan) is EPL-6200L compatible,
  and EPL-2180 (an A3 printer sold in China and the Philipines) also - for the
  latter we may extend the paper size support if this can be confirmed.
  (LP-800S=5900L?, LP-1200 owners please comment).

I have tested this driver myself with EPSON AcuLaser M1200
and it worked just fine so i decided to share the way how get this printer to run under Linux.
I've tested it with Ubuntu 18.04  and also a great lightweight distro called Antix Linux (ver 22)

So here is a step by step guide how i managed to run the printer with Antix Linux:

1.So first be sure you have a gcc compiler installed (it should be alredy there when you install system)
2. Then you should install: sudo apt install libc6-dev
3. Download epsoneplijs.tgz
4. From terminal, in the directory where you downloaded epsoneplijs.tgz file, type command: tar zxvf epsoneplijs.tgz
5. Go to directory epsoneplijs, which you just created, with command: cd epsoneplijs
6. Type command: ./configure --prefix=/usr  (i executed it without --prefix=/usr,  only ./configure worked for me)
7. Type command: sudo make install
8. Now from the directory epsoneplijs copy a freshy compiled file ijs_server_epsonepl to folder /usr/bin (you can do that with midnight commander as root)
9. Download file: EPL-6200L-Hardy.ppd  
10. Connect your printer to your computer and turn it on. (You can do it in the beginning, but at least now you need it connected and powered on.)
11. Reboot computer
12. Go to System Settings → Printing → click “Add” and choose from the list Epson AL-M1200.
13. Click "Forward".The system searches for drivers for some time and then gives “New printer”-window with the title “Choose driver”.
14. Tick the box "Provide PPD file” and navigate to the directory where you downloaded it and choose it.
15. Click "Open" and "Forward". Ubuntu asks if you want a test page. You can try to print the test page now. It should work.
