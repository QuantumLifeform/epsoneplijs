Requirement
===========
  Type "gs -h" to get your ghostscript version and device list. You need 
  GNU ghostscript 6.53+ or AFPL Ghostscript 7.04+, and the "ijs" device 
  listed among the device list to use this plugin.

  AFPL ghostscript 8.0 has some yet unidentified issues, and known not to 
  work. Avoid it for the time being.

USB on 5700L
============
  Printing via USB connectivity to the 5700L is supported via two
  mechanisms: the generic Linux kernel device, or via the libusb package.
  Support for both can be compiled in together, but they are mutually 
  exclusive at runtime - the kernel device requires the kernel module 
  "printer.o" loaded, while the libusb code requires the kernel module not
  loaded. The former mechanism is more compatible with the rest of Linux's
  USB sub-system, but it is quite linux-specific. The latter is probably
  more portable (libusb has been ported to FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin
  MacOS X).

  The kernel device code is probably best trouble-shoot through syslogs, etc.

  As for the libusb code, f you see "can't claim USB device" and got 
  directed here, you need to check a few things concerning permissions:

  (1) /proc/bus/usb is mounted, 

  (2) the person running the plugin has read/write privilege to most of the 
      files under there. 

  (3) the kernel printer class driver "printer" is NOT loaded (running 
      "lsmod" does NOT list "printer"). The kernel driver does not provide 
      access mechanism sophisticated enough for this printer to work,
      so loading the driver only interferes with the plugin's operation.

      Beware that some systems may autoload the kernel driver at boot-up 
      time. 
   
   There is a test5700lusb binary in libusb/tests/ which would get the 5700L
   connected via USB to spit out a blank page. Run it before reporting
   any problems, and please attach the whole of testlibusb's output
   (it scans your USB and output every piece of info it finds)
   when you report problems.

USB on 5800L, 5900L, 6100L
==========================
  USB support has been recently extended to all printers. IF you want to try
  it, just follow the same instructions given for 5700L.
  This is experimental, at the moment.

Usage Problems
==============
*) What linux distribution does it work on?

  See ***Requirement*** above.

  Failure (too old): RH 7.1 (gs 5.50), RH 7.2 (?), ASPLinux 7.2

  Developer's choices: Slackware 8.1 (HTL), Redhat 8.0 (RR)
 
  Reported Success: SuSE 7.3 (FE), Mandrake 9.0 (CS), Debian 3.0 (JM), 
                    SuSE 8.0 (HS), Mandrake 8.2 (AC)

  The code has reportedly been ported successfully to FreeBSD.

*) "ijs_server_epsonepl: command not found"
   "Can't start ijs server "ijs_server_epsonepl""

  The binary 'ijs_server_epsonepl' needs to be in your $PATH. Check your 
  $PATH variable with "echo $PATH", and/or verify with 
  'which ijs_server_epsonepl'. Copy the binary into /usr/bin as last resort. 

*) "Unknown device: ijs"
   
   See ***Requirement*** above.

*) "I want CUPS support"
   
   There are some foomatic data in the foomatic sub-directory. If you have 
   foomatic installed, you can generates PPD files for CUPS. Browse the
   user mailing list archive for clues (link at the bottom of 
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/).

*) "I can't get this f#$%&ing thing to work"

   Browse the user mailing list archive for clues (link at the bottom of 
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/).
   
*) The print out is slight displaced.

   The default paper size for CUPS is "letter" (a lot of US-based
   print-related software, including ghostscript itself, and e.g. 
   most M$ windows driver for HP printers, defaults to "letter"). 
   Many things can happen if you have "letter" declared somewhere
   and "A4" elsewhere, and vice versa.

   A4 is 17pt narrower (about 1/4 inch or 6mm), and 50 pt longer (17mm).

   Try to save the postscript file your application generates.
   The top a postscript file contains these two lines:

      %!PS-Adobe-3.0
      %%BoundingBox: 0 0 612 792 

   (612, 792) is letter. (595, 842) is A4. These numbers are in pt's 
   (= 1/72 inch, a traditional type-setter's measure).
